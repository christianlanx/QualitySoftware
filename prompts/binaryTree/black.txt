You are a test engineer.
Write me a test suite to cover the class described in the following description, using the provided method signature.
Write the test suite using junit 5.
Just return the code for the test class.

Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.
Example 1:
Input: preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Example 2:
Input: preorder = [-1], inorder = [-1]
Output: [-1]
Constraints:
1 <= preorder.length <= 3000
inorder.length == preorder.length
-3000 <= preorder[i], inorder[i] <= 3000
preorder and inorder consist of unique values.
Each value of inorder also appears in preorder.
preorder is guaranteed to be the preorder traversal of the tree.
inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.

and follow this method signature:

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class BinaryTree {
    public TreeNode buildTree(int[] preorder, int[] inorder) {
        
    }
}
