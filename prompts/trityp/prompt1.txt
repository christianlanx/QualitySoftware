Write me a test suite to cover this description using junit4:
Given three integers representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle, implement a function to determine the type of triangle these sides would form.

The function should return an integer corresponding to one of the following classifications:

Scalene: All three sides are of different lengths.
Isosceles: Two sides are of the same length.
Equilateral: All three sides are of the same length.
Invalid Triangle: The given side lengths do not satisfy the triangle inequality, or one or more side lengths are non-positive, meaning they cannot form a valid triangle.


and follow this method signature: 
public class Trityp {
    public static int Triang(int Side1, int Side2, int Side3) {
    }
}
