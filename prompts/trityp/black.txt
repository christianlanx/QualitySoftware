You are a test engineer.
Write me a test suite to cover the class described in the following description, using the provided method signature.
Write the test suite using junit 5.
Just return the code for the test class.

Given three integers representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle, implement a function to determine the type of triangle these sides would form.

The function should return an integer corresponding to one of the following classifications:

Scalene: All three sides are of different lengths.
Isosceles: Two sides are of the same length.
Equilateral: All three sides are of the same length.
Invalid Triangle: The given side lengths do not satisfy the triangle inequality, or one or more side lengths are non-positive, meaning they cannot form a valid triangle.


and follow this method signature: 
public class Trityp {
    public static int Triang(int Side1, int Side2, int Side3) {
    }
}
